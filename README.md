This is my porting of well-known (in Pentaho world) SteelWheels database. I could not find any PostgreSQL script / dump, so I ported MySQL version from Mondrian distribution.

SteelWheels database is used in Report Designer examples as well as as numerous tutorials & books exploit this database.
So, I hope it will be useful for PostgreSQL fans.


Feel free to edit create_steelwheels_posgres.sh script: set your own host, port, user, etc.
